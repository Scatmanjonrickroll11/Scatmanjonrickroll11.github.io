  The Namecheap Redemption Arc
</h1>
<right> <p class="subtitle"><strong>Published 2022-06-04</strong></p><br> </right>
<p>So, dear reader, <a href="/blog/namecheapaaaa">last time</a> on the Eve Gets Fucked Chronicles, I was whining like a bitch about my problematic time with Gandi Mail. </p>
<p>Okay, so you'll be glad to hear that fuck all changed with the Gandi Mail part of that post.
However!
One little addendum I would like to make, after the event: the Namecheap support team got back in touch with me! As you can likely tell, seeing as we're back to jellyfox.moe, AS OUR FOUNDING FATHERS INTENDED.</p>
<p>So? What was my experience like with them?</p>
<p>Oh my fucking god they were so nice Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Seriously - I have had to interface with many a support line over many a topic, but never have I actually had real humans respond so quickly. Obviously, there was an initial automated response, just to confirm my ticket had been logged and such. But then, I got an email more or less straight back from a real, whole-ass, carbon-based, oxygen-inhaling, carbon-dioxide-exhaling human!</p>
<p>And they were so lovely and helpful!</p>
<p>I enquired within my original support email as to exactly <em>why</em> they had enabled 2FA on my account - especially since I hadn't requested it. It turns out that it's part of some sort of required push for security, as, in the words of the email, &quot;it's essential on the modern internet&quot;, which I completely agree with. I've got 2FA set up with my account now just in case of any future incidents, however.</p>
<p>And after that, just so I could get into my account and change all my shit across to not dead stuff, they disabled the 2FA temporarily and allowed me access to my account inside of <em>an hour.</em> All throughout, both customer service reps I spoke with being the most cordial, polite and helpful support people I've had the pleasure of talking to. </p>
<p>Okay, listen, I'm not saying that I'm a little bitch and I <em>cried</em> or anything over how lovely I found them to be, but... okay, yeah, that is what I'm saying. It was just so lovely of them to have helped as efficiently and as well as they did. </p>
<p>So, on the incredibly slim chance that anybody reading this is from Namecheap: good shit. Keep that shit going, dudes. Your customer service actually made me cry with fucking joy.</p>
<p>And to the regular reader, I cannot recommend that you use Namecheap enough. Their shit's fucking kino. Absolute doddle to set up your shit with.</p>
